<h1>Bowling Game</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I loved going bowling growing up, but was always confused as to how the scoring was calculated. This gave me the idea to create a bowling score calculator.</p>
        <a href="tenpincalculator.html"><button class="button">Play Game</button></a>
    <button class="button">View on GitHub</button>
    
    
<h1>Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Normal game play</h2>
    <p>The calculator consists of 10 frames, where the player selects how many pins are knocked down. <br>The current frame for the player is highlighted</p>

    <p>Within each frame, the player has 2 opportunities to knock all ten pins down.<br>If less than 10 pins are knocked down, the total number of pins knocked down is displayed in the frame. Scores will be tallied into the frame in question.<br>As per below example, a total of 6 was scored in frame 1 and 3 was scored in frame 2 hence a total of 9 is displayed.</p>

    <h2>Strikes</h2>
    <p>Knock all 10 pins down on your first throw - This is called a strike and indicated by an <b>X</b>. 10 points are added to your score <b>as well as the sum of the next 2 throws.</b><br>As per below example, the player got a strike on his first throw (10 points) plus 8 for the next 2 throws, hence a total of 18 was scored for frame one. </p>

    <h2>Spares</h2>
<p>Knock all 10 pins in 2 throws  - This is called a spare and indicated by a <b>slash</b>. 10 points are added to your score <b>as well as the sum of the next throw only</b><br>As per below example, the player got a 6 on his first throw, 4 on his second throw and scored a spare.  (10 points) plus 5 for the next 1 throw only hence a total of 15 was scored for frame one. </p>
